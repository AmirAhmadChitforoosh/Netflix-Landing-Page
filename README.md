# Description
This project is a frontend development practice inspired by the [Traversy Media tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7t13SGytRk&t=4s). The aim was to enhance my frontend skills by replicating a classic design of Netflix's landing page. I highly recommend checking out the tutorial—it’s an excellent resource for developers at any level.

# Lessons Learned
- Improved understanding of HTML & CSS structure
- Gained experience working with flexbox/grid layouts
- Understanding and manipulating the DOM
- Implementing JavaScript `EventListeners` to add interactivity

# Acknowledgments
